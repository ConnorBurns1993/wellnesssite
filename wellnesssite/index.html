          <h2>Practice Being in the Moment</h2>
          <p>There is so much to think about in life. What will you do for money, how should you raise your family,
              how you are going to spend your time. Life is full of so many decisions it's easy to get caught
              in your thoughts. What life really is though is what you do and how you are in the moment. The moment
              is where all of your reality happens and what effects your future. Practicing bringing
              yourself into the moment and realizing what you are doing in every moment can make you
              more aware and cause you to make decisions and enjoy and live this very moment and that in turn will
              turn your future into a positive one (that is, if you're making positive decisions in the moment!)

          <h2>Meditation is for Everyone</h2>
          <p>When you think of meditation, you may think of sitting with your legs crossed and chanting
              or breathing deeply and focusing on your breath. You may have already tried meditation and given up quickly
              because you are just too jittery. But meditation is a great tool to slow your mind
              in this fast-paced world we live in. All you really need to do is sit comfortably, close your eyes and breathe.
              I personally don't focus on my breath but instead I let all my thoughts come to me and I observe them and I observe what
              I'm really thinking about. Allowing yourself 15 minutes a day to just sit and breathe and observe your thoughts will
              award you with a sense of peace for the rest of the day.
